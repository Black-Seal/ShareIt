# ShareIt - A rental service for all things

[**Public Domain**](https://nice-pebble-069dc3c00.5.azurestaticapps.net)

ShareIt is a web-based platform that enables community members to rent out their underutilised items to others.

This repository specifically contains only the **frontend** part of the website. It is hosted through the `Static Web App` service on Microsoft Azure.

The **backend** for this website will be supported by `Azure Functions`, a separate service that can handle the backend logic without the need for managing servers.
